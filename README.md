# FFXIV Deliverables
iOS app to scan Final Fantasy XIV item deliverables for Grand Company provisioning, call XIVAPI, and create list with item details.

Item lists are populated by providing the app with a screenshot of the Grand Company deliverables list. It then creates an array of item names' strings and calls XIVAPI to get its image, ID, and provide a link to Teamcraft to quickly find information on finding or crafting the daily items.
