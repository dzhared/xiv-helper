# XIV Helper
An iOS app to help players easily find item and crafting information and create material lists for their crafts.

This app previously used live calls to XIVAPI, but as of version 2.0.0, now uses a prebuilt CoreData database to populate SwiftData, which also contains userâ€™s saved recipes. This allows richer integration between items, recipes, and ingredients, as well as more useful search sorting tools.

Data is compiled from various JSON files used in [FFXIV Teamcraft](https://github.com/ffxiv-teamcraft/ffxiv-teamcraft), and static images for item icons are retrieved from XIVAPI.
