        This app helps find and organize item and recipe information for Final Fantasy XIV. To \
        find an item or recipe, tap the search icon on the bottom bar and search by item name. \
        Relevant item and recipe information, including stats, bonuses, relevant leves and Grand \
        Company turnins, and more is displayed on an item's detail page.

        To save a craftable item's recipe, tap a Recipe on its \(AppStrings.Navigation.itemDetail) \
        screen, if any are available. This displays crafting information, including an ingredient \
        list and relevant stats. To save a recipe, tap the + icon to add it, and choose a desired \
        quantity to craft. This will add it to the Saved Recipes tab. Items that yield more than \
        one are selected in multiples of their respective yield.

        To generate a shopping list for all the recipes you've saved, tap the \
        \(AppStrings.User.createShoppingList) button on the \(AppStrings.Navigation.savedRecipes) \
        tab. This aggregates the ingredients from all the recipes with their respective quantities \
        to make shopping for ingredients much easier.
